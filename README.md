# TIC TAC TOE
Simple tic-tac-toe game first created with the React Tutorial. I made this to play tic-tac-toe with my son who increasingly has started to beat me more often at this game.

I plan on using this game to introduce him to coding. He is my user. We're starting out with a really basic game and I will be making changes based on his preferences. Let's see how this turns out.

## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. Open repo in a terminal, vs code, or anything of the like that you prefer
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Open the game in a browser and play
